## Advertising

I sell advertising on this websites, both directly and indirectly through third-party advertising networks and market places. These include graphic, rich media and no followed text-based advertisements. If I sell an advertisement that looks like a standard blog entry or article, I will label it as such, clearly and up front at the beginning of the blog post or article.

If I am paid by a company, organization or third-party to write about a specific entity, product, service, etc., I will disclose that, clearly and up front at the beginning of the blog post or article.

## Affiliate Links

I use affiliate links wherever possible. These are links that allow me to earn credit or a portion of the proceeds for any sale or action converted by people who click on them.

Sometimes, this is done automatically through a service like [Skimlinks ][1]that passes all links on my site, including those posted by other people in a comments section, through a third party filter to check if the site being linked to has an affiliate program. If so, I will be credited for any sales generated through that link and will receive a portion of the proceeds. The page that is displayed, after being redirected through the filter, will be the page that was initially linked to. At no time is a link redirected to any page other than the one that was originally linked to.

When I manually insert an affiliate link in a blog post or article where we are reviewing or endorsing a product or service, I’ll disclose this in the actual blog post or article, to the best of my ability. Because I use services that automatically create affiliate links, I may not always be aware of their inclusion. But, if I am aware, I will disclose them.

## Acceptance of Free Products, Services, etc.

I accept free products, services, tickets, invitations and more from companies, organizations and individuals.

If I write a review, endorsement or article related to the free good or service provided (or the reason it was provided), I will disclose it’s receipt in the blog post or article to the best of my ability.

## I’ll Be Honest

However, my opinion is just that: my opinion. It can’t be bought, sold or traded for. I will always aim to review an item or entity in an honest and fair manner – positive or negative. Any and all freebies or perks are accepted with this understanding. If anyone wishes to place a “speak no evil” contingency upon me, I tell them to keep their freebie. I recognize the value of integrity and honesty in my work.

If I have a particular “conflict of interest” that I feel is noteworthy, I will do my very best to disclose it. I am human and things get forgotten.

If you ever have any questions about this policy or if you think I may have forgotten to disclose something, please do not hesitate to contact me. Any omissions are accidental and unintended.
