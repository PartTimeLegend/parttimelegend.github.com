So we are a few episodes into the latest series and it started a little rough, and now it seems to be amazing!


I was very disappointed to see they had killed of Mitchell, George and Nina! Though Hal kinda just makes this series worth watching. He’s a great character and I’m looking forward to more.

What do we all think so far?
