I have so many apps on my phone that I can’t live without. Some of them are every day apps and some are used on the odd occasion, but I just can’t be without them.

Let’s start off with my favourites and see how we go.

## Google Maps

You can’t have a smartphone without having GPS and Google Maps is my starting point for finding my way somewhere in a new city.

I would be rather shocked if you don’t use it.

 

## Facebook

[![ Android Apps You Cant Live Without][3]][3]The Social Network. You can’t really live in the modern world and not have a Facebook account. Love it or hate it, you need to use it to communicate with friends and know what’s going on in people’s lives. Even if they aren’t doing anything interesting. You are a media junkie and you can’t help yourself.

## Whatsapp

We live in a world where messaging is instant and free. This is my favourite messaging app for my phone.[![ Android Apps You Cant Live Without][4]][4]

## eBay

[![ Android Apps You Cant Live Without][5]][5]We all love eBay you can buy almost anything there. Sometimes you want to use it just to see what there is.

You can place bids from the application and watch auctions.

 

## TVCatchup

[![ Android Apps You Cant Live Without][6]][6] This is a new app for me. I am often out and about and don’t get chance to watch the TV shows I want to watch. This means I am able to watch them when I am out. It’s definitely a plus for me.

## Chrome

Why use the Android stock browser when you can use Chrome? It will sync all your data via Chrome Sync.[![ Android Apps You Cant Live Without][7]][7]

If you could add Chrome Extensions then it would be absolutely perfect.

 

## Amazon

How do you survive without Amazon? I live to shop here. The barcode scanner is amazing, as I can scan in store and then buy here cheaper. I also do a lot of market research work for amazon vouchers.

 

## SoundHound

I love listening to music. I can’t get enough of music, and when I’m out I often hear a song and think I want to know who it is. Hold up SoundHound for a few seconds and you know!

 

 

## Sky 

[![ Android Apps You Cant Live Without][10]][10]Second on my TV list. When I’m talking with people and they say I should watch a show, I can look it up and record with a few clicks.

## Wikipedia

Imagine a world without Wikipedia? You can’t! This app is great for formatting the pages so you can read them easily on your handset.

## BaconReader

Do you use Reddit? This is my Reddit client.

 

 

## Dropbox

I would be lost without Dropbox. I keep my files here so that I can access them remotely and on the move. The application allows me to upload my pictures automatically so they appear on my home digital photo frames.

 

## Google Authenticator

If you use Gmail you should enable the two factor authentication. This is the perfect app for you, as it will generate your login codes. The extra layer of security is great for added peace of mind.

 

 

## JuiceDefender

Sometimes doing more with your phone makes your battery last less. This is my chosen application to save as much battery power as possible and reduce the need for extra charges through the day.

 

 

So that’s my list of apps I cannot live without. There are more I use regularly, but these are my chosen ones to share.

What’s your top app?
