So chances are that you are already aware of Bitcoin. If not, you should go read about it.

There are several ways to generate coin, these are either through purchasing coin, referral systems and mining.

## Mining

Back in the early days of Bitcoin, you could easily mine for currency. These days it’s not so simple as the chains get more complicated. Did you know? You’re mining coin right now! One of the revenue earning services of this site is Bitcoinplus which is operating on this site right now. The spare CPU cycles of your machine are being used to help fund the content you are reading.

While mining will still work, it is likely not very cost effective. The power used to mine compared with the returns you get are drastically outweighed. There are people who build mining rigs, however I find that having distributed machines all running a small amount during their normal operation works just as well.



## Referrals

There is not much to be gained via referrals for Bitcoin in my experience. The only reliable sites I’ve found to date have been Bitvisitor which pays you to visit a site for 5 minutes. The problem is that there is only a few sites available

for viewing and you quickly get bored. [I Want Free Bit Coins][4] which allows you to complete offers to earn bitcoin. It seems a bit spammy, but I’ve been paid by them.

## Purchase

Now for the extreme need to get bitcoin in a hurry, you can buy it from various online markets. I won’t name any, but you can google to find them pretty easily.

Remember if you are selling bitcoin, that it is completely anonymous and without the control of a chargeback so be sure you trust the buyer.

I have been using Bitcoin for about 2 years now, and find it rather useful for retaining value.

Oh and feel free to send me some free bitcoin: 13BrFJVFX6ao7LtzqR92vgYeMBC3va6pe8
