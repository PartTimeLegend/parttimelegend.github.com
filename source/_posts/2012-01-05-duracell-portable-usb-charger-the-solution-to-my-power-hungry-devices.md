If you’re like me, and I think you are. Then you have an amazing need for electricity when you are out of the home.

You have your Mobile Phone, Work Mobile Phone, iPod, iPad, [Kindle][1] and whatever else you feel the need to carry around with you each and every single day.

The problem with this is that you need a reliable and easily accessible power source and until they master [wireless electricity transfer][2] across the globe then you will be stuck in this near impossible situation.

Or will we be?

About a week ago I was out with my Mother and she mentioned she had heard of the Duracell Portable USB Charger and it would be perfect for me. I must admit, I completely forgot all about it until I saw an advertisement for it a few days ago.

I promptly went to[ Amazon][3] and bought one.

Today I came home from work to find it had arrived.



I’m not going to bore you with an unboxing images, as it comes in the standard packaging you see in the product pictures .

Obviously I can’t tell you if it achieves the full 5 hours of charge time it offers, but I can give you my initial impressions.

The plug is detachable, so that it better fits in your pocket. Unfortunately this has not been done in the best possible way. The plug is removed and the metal pins that it connects to on the actual device are still extruding from the device. This seems a very poor design fault, as these are easily caught when put in a pocket as shown the first time I tried putting it in my pocket.

The second, and most noticeable design fault is one that I struggle to believe the designers could ever miss. You can’t turn the plug on when the device is in the socket. The battery part of it covers the switch, so you have to turn the socket on and then plug the device in. I’m sure I was always taught this wasn’t safe.

I will update when I know more about the device.
