It’s been quite some time since I last had a blag. I was wondering why I hadn’t bothered of late and realised the only reason was that my old webhost suspended my account with no reason and wouldn’t respond to my attempts to get in touch with them.

I guess you’re wondering what has changed, well so many things have changed that it’s hard to know where to start.

I recently decided that it was time to move on from my job as a [software developer][2] for a [software house][3] in [Liverpool City Centre][4]. I decided to see what was out there, and I found a position I thought would be a good fit for myself. Unfortunately it didn’t go according to plan and so I left there after a short while. I am now working for a company in [Manchester][5].

It’s been Christmas! I love Christmas it’s my favourite time of the year. I’ve got some awesome presents from my friends and family including Banana Socks off by BFF and a Slow Cooker from my Parents.

I always try to put as much effort into Christmas shopping as I possible can. I aim to get gifts that make the recipient laugh, but also know that I have really thought about  them. This year, I did so much shopping so early on that I totally forgot what I lot of the gifts where, so when people unwrapped their gifts on [Christmas day][7], I was just as excited as them.

Tomorrow it’s back to work, and I am looking forward to it. I’ll talk more about my job in the future, as it’s a huge part of my life. I love my job and the people I work with.
