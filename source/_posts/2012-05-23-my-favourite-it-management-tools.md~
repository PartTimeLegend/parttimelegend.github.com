twork you are obviously wasting your time and money. It’s asset management, network monitoring, cloud monitoring, software compliance monitoring, load monitoring, knowledge base, support ticket with full Active Directory integration. You have a mix of Windows, Mac and *nix machines? No problem. Printers? Sure thing! You can even use it to log IP phones connected to your network. There is a great community of people, plugins and reports. If you want any more, well it’s simple enough to write a few plugins.

There is built in malware protection. It checks sites against a known blacklist of dangerous sites and monitors your outbound traffic for botnet behaviour.

 

**Papercut NG**

 

Now they can’t all be free. Though this one is worth the money it will help you save. You have people in your business who like to print? Print everything? Emails? Word documents? Websites before they read them? Well papercut will help you monitor and educate your users. Use the monitoring only? Show people the costs associated with their printing? You can even override the print settings the user set. You can redirect the print to a cheaper server based on print size. You can suspend print rights for users, you can stop them printing in colour. It’s a fantastic product.
