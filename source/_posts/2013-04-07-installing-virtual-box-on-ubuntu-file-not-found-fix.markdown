I love Linux, I always have. It just makes me feel more in control, even if I have no idea what I'm doing.

Unfortunately every now and then I need to use Windows. Well, I don't see the need for a dual boot when I can just use [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and install the Windows XP/7/8 disks I have on a bookshelf.

Well I recently installed [Ubuntu](http://http://www.ubuntu.com/) on my laptop. I have used several distros over the years and I always liked [Debian](http://www.debian.org/). So I decided to use the fork that is meant to be easier to use (was Debian hard?).

Anyway I digress.
