Yesterday, I attended [SQL][1] Relay 2012. A conference run by the wonderful people at SQL Server FAQ.

I took this oportunity to see an old colleague from a previous job, someone I haven’t seen for a few years now.

We arrived in the morning, and were presented with our goody bags (loads of marketing leaflets, nothing special) and told to go upstairs for breakfast! I was thinking “Breakfast? This ought to be good” in my sarcastic inner monologue. Well we went upstairs to be given a cup of tea and a bacon roll. This was a great start.

Then on to the talks.

 

After the general housekeeping announcements, it was on to the first speaker:

**Morris Novello**

With a strange mix of Italian and English to his accent, at first I was a little unsure of what he was saying (sorry, Morris). I soon acclimatised as he started talking his through the features. His was the first talk, so it would always be hard to get everyone enthused first thing.

**Andrew Fryer**

A man who some may argue is a little too excited about SQL Server. He promised us no powerpoint, and instead turned a camera onto a sheet of paper which he decided to draw the topics we discussed on.

He had several virtual machines, that he constantly flipped through whilst he exclaimed the virtues of SQL 2012.



**[Jamie Thompson]**

This was the part I was there for. I’ll be honest, I still think [SSIS][4] is the greatest thing [Microsoft][5] has done in a long time. I loved every second of it. I sat there just thinking of the possibilities.

**Tony Rogerson**

Now Tony is a greatly respected man, however he starts talking about how [SSD][6] is faster than standard drives. I knew this. We all knew this. I started to drift off, sorry.

**Chris Testa O’neil**

The last talk I stayed for. This was about the idea of AlwaysON. I think this was better suited to someone who didn’t have a cloud provider in place. I’ve got to admit [Azure][7], doesn’t really appeal to me.
