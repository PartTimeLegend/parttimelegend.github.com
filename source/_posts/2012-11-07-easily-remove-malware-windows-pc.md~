The number of times this occurs has increased dramatically in the last few years, well I’ve decided to write-up a quick guide on how to remove the malware you have got.

So now you have downloaded the only tool you need. Let’s begin removing your malware. If you are reading this post and looking to remove malware from your PC I would recommend printing it or loading it up on your tablet. Unless you have a great memory.

## Step 2

Reboot your computer into [Safe Mode][5]. You can do this by powering your computer down and pressing F8 during boot (Shift F8 / F20 in [Windows 8][6]).
