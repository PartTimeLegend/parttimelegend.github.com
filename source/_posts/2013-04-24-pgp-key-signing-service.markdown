So you've got your PGP Key and you want to get it signed? Excellent. That's how we build this [Web of Trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust).

## Why would I want my key signed?

If you consider your PGP key as your digital identity then you must see the need to have this verified. The more signatures the more you are trusted.

## Will I sign your key?

Sure will. All I need is for you to contact me to arrange a meeting. I would appreciate it if you also signed my key at the same time.

## What do I need to bring?

I use a [verification form](https://github.com/PartTimeLegend/web-of-trust-verification-forms) that I have released publically. You can either add your details and print it or hand write your details. I normally have a few spare when I meet people so you can always ask if you've not got one.

Just bring two forms of identification. I'll accept most things, but for reference:

* Passport
* Driving Licence
* Utility Bill
* Bank Statement
* Military Id Card
* National Id Card
* Student Id Card
* Birth Certificate

I will not accept:

* Self printed online banking statement
* Letter from your grandmother

## Do you charge for this service?

This is a good question. The answer is a difficult one to answer.

I may ask for you to contribute towards travel costs either in full or part. This depends on your location and how I am feeling.

I may also as part of the verification process ask to take a £1 card payment from you. Once verified I will refund this amount to you as I only want to ensure you are able to authorise a payment. I will process this payment at location via mPOS.

## What information do you store?

I store nothing. I only want to see your identification documents, I don't note any details and my memory isn't good enough to remember them anyway.

I will retain the paper document we complete with our details on. I store these until I get to a computer I can sign your key from. Once signed this document will be shredded, pulped, compressed and then burnt.

## I don't live in your city/country can will you still sign my key?

I take these on a per request basis. Due to the nature of this, I will have to look carefully at your details and others who have signed your key. I reserve the right to charge for this service as it requires due dilligence on my part. This charge would not exceed £10 or tbe equivilent in your country and should be made via Bank Transfer to further confirm your identity. This will not result in a signature of absolute trust, you will receive a casual signature as I cannot absolutely gaurantee your identity.

## What keys have you signed and have signed you?
