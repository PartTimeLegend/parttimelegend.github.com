  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>When you are working in IT Management, you need to make your life a little easier. You also want to make your life easier without making the bean counters freak out with the costs you bring to them.</p>

<p>So let’s kick this off with the free things:</p>

<p><strong>Spiceworks</strong></p>

<p>If you don’t use Spiceworks on your network you are obviously wasting your time and money. It’s asset management, network monitoring, cloud monitoring, software compliance monitoring, load monitoring, knowledge base, support ticket with full Active Directory integration. You have a mix of Windows, Mac and *nix machines? No problem. Printers? Sure thing! You can even use it to log IP phones connected to your network. There is a great community of people, plugins and reports. If you want any more, well it’s simple enough to write a few plugins.</p>

<p><strong>OpenDNS</strong></p>

<p>So you want to introduce content filtering and you don’t have the budget for expensive equipment and software? Well</p>

<p>OpenDNS will give you these features. Just change your DNS servers to theirs. Register an account to change content filtering rules. You can even brand it to your own styles.</p>

<p>There is built in malware protection. It checks sites against a known blacklist of dangerous sites and monitors your outbound traffic for botnet behaviour.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Papercut NG</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Now they can’t all be free. Though this one is worth the money it will help you save. You have people in your business who like to print? Print everything? Emails? Word documents? Websites before they read them? Well papercut will help you monitor and educate your users. Use the monitoring only? Show people the costs associated with their printing? You can even override the print settings the user set. You can redirect the print to a cheaper server based on print size. You can suspend print rights for users, you can stop them printing in colour. It’s a fantastic product.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>Having been developing software for as long as I can recall, this is a question that people often ask me.</p>

<p>As I’m currently looking for a new job, this is a time where I can asses the changes in development over the years and how I think people should go forward with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process" title="Software development process">development life cycle</a> and anything you might want to consider.</p>

<p>I’m not the greatest software developer in the world, I will be the first to admit this. I’ve been developing for about 14 years, and I have made mistakes and I will again. I just think I’ve made enough mistakes to have an idea of what I’m doing going forward.</p>

<p>So you’re now wondering about the language to choose.</p>

<p>You need to consider the following when choosing your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language" title="Programming language">programming language</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Current skill set</li>
<li>Platform</li>
<li>User Experience</li>
<li>Ability to maintain</li>
<li>Support of the language</li>
<li>Storage available</li>
<li>So many others</li>
</ul>


<p>So you know a programming language? Well done! That’s the first step. However remember just because you know a language, doesn’t mean it’s the best for the situation. I know how to write Java, I don’t think I’ll use it for my blog.</p>

<p>You have a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/WINDOWS" title="Windows">Windows</a> Server / Linux? This is a big thing, as you can use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework" title=".NET Framework">.NET</a> on a Windows server and not on Linux (ignore Mono, it’s horrible). You want to create a website? Then you are looking at the ASP.NET / <a href="http://www.php.net" title="PHP">PHP</a> choice most of the time. While both will work on a Windows Server. Only PHP can be run on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" title="Linux">Linux box</a>.</p>

<p>Are you planning to use <a href="http://www.iis.net/" title="Internet Information Services">IIS</a>? Apache? Something else? Remember IIS is only on Windows.</p>

<p>Obviously if you’re writing a form based application, the language choices are different again and it this case I might very well use Java for both sides.</p>

<p>User Experience is a very important part of the development of a new software package. Unfortunately a lot of developers don’t see this as an important enough thing and many packages are technically perfect, but are unusable by the client. There are simple things to check this, like looking for too many clicks, loading new pages to show information that can be presented easily on one. I’ve used systems that have text boxes that can’t be edited and have to go through other screens to implement changes.</p>

<p>I’ve been a Windows Developer for a while now, not that I don’t dabble in others (this webserver is Linux). I see legacy packages written in VB6 and new packages in <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vcsharp/aa336809.aspx" title="C Sharp (programming language)">C#.NET</a> and they show. The C# layout looks much more modern, the rounded edges that you expect in Windows 7.</p>

<p>The ability to support a language is crucial. Remember any large package is going to need more than one developer. Can you recruit these easily and within your budget? Look at job sites and see about availability.</p>

<p>Is the language nearing end of life? Don’t bother with a language with a short life left. Unless it’s completely unavoidable due to other platform constraints.</p>

<p>Storage, could be the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_size" title="File size">Database size</a> or the size of the files? Some databases are in the terabyte range that you can’t keep up. Sometimes you are limited on disk space, and in others by limitations of the language. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_Server_Express" title="SQL Server Express">SQL Server Express</a> has a limit on database size that you can very easily reach.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>So I could go on and on about the concerns of programming language choice and you can’t learn them all.</p>

<p>The languages I would recommend you learning or using are only a suggestion and you should asses the needs of your development. They are:</p>

<ul>
<li>C#</li>
<li>ASP.NET</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>Microsoft SQL Server</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>jQuery</li>
<li>ASM (Yes, ASM it’s great)</li>
</ul>

<p>So we are a few episodes into the latest series and it started a little rough, and now it seems to be amazing!</p>

<p>I was very disappointed to see they had killed of Mitchell, George and Nina! Though Hal kinda just makes this series worth watching. He’s a great character and I’m looking forward to more.</p>

<p>What do we all think so far?</p>

<p>If you’re like me, and I think you are. Then you have an amazing need for electricity when you are out of the home.</p>

<p>You have your Mobile Phone, Work Mobile Phone, iPod, iPad, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Wireless-Reader-Wifi-Graphite/dp/B002Y27P3M?SubscriptionId=0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82&amp;tag=myjungleshop-21&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=B002Y27P3M" title="Kindle Wireless Reading Device, Wi-Fi, 6&quot; Display, Graphite - Latest Generation">Kindle</a> and whatever else you feel the need to carry around with you each and every single day.</p>

<p>The problem with this is that you need a reliable and easily accessible power source and until they master <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_energy_transfer" title="Wireless energy transfer">wireless electricity transfer</a> across the globe then you will be stuck in this near impossible situation.</p>

<p>Or will we be?</p>

<p>About a week ago I was out with my Mother and she mentioned she had heard of the Duracell Portable USB Charger and it would be perfect for me. I must admit, I completely forgot all about it until I saw an advertisement for it a few days ago.</p>

<p>I promptly went to<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Duracell-Mobile-Phone-Portable-Charger/dp/B005EKK2SG/ref=pd_sxp_grid_pt_0_1"> Amazon</a> and bought one.</p>

<p>Today I came home from work to find it had arrived.</p>

<p>I’m not going to bore you with an unboxing images, as it comes in the standard packaging you see in the product pictures .</p>

<p>Obviously I can’t tell you if it achieves the full 5 hours of charge time it offers, but I can give you my initial impressions.</p>

<p>The plug is detachable, so that it better fits in your pocket. Unfortunately this has not been done in the best possible way. The plug is removed and the metal pins that it connects to on the actual device are still extruding from the device. This seems a very poor design fault, as these are easily caught when put in a pocket as shown the first time I tried putting it in my pocket.</p>

<p>The second, and most noticeable design fault is one that I struggle to believe the designers could ever miss. You can’t turn the plug on when the device is in the socket. The battery part of it covers the switch, so you have to turn the socket on and then plug the device in. I’m sure I was always taught this wasn’t safe.</p>

<p>I will update when I know more about the device.</p>

<p>It’s been quite some time since I last had a blag. I was wondering why I hadn’t bothered of late and realised the only reason was that my old webhost suspended my account with no reason and wouldn’t respond to my attempts to get in touch with them.</p>

<p>I guess you’re wondering what has changed, well so many things have changed that it’s hard to know where to start.</p>

<p>I recently decided that it was time to move on from my job as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_developer" title="Software developer">software developer</a> for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_house" title="Software house">software house</a> in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=53.407,-2.9915&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=53.407,-2.9915" title="Liverpool City Centre">Liverpool City Centre</a>. I decided to see what was out there, and I found a position I thought would be a good fit for myself. Unfortunately it didn’t go according to plan and so I left there after a short while. I am now working for a company in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=53.4666666667,-2.23333333333&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=53.4666666667,-2.23333333333" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>.</p>

<p>It’s been Christmas! I love Christmas it’s my favourite time of the year. I’ve got some awesome presents from my friends and family including Banana Socks off by BFF and a Slow Cooker from my Parents.</p>

<p>I always try to put as much effort into Christmas shopping as I possible can. I aim to get gifts that make the recipient laugh, but also know that I have really thought about  them. This year, I did so much shopping so early on that I totally forgot what I lot of the gifts where, so when people unwrapped their gifts on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas" title="Christmas">Christmas day</a>, I was just as excited as them.</p>

<p>Tomorrow it’s back to work, and I am looking forward to it. I’ll talk more about my job in the future, as it’s a huge part of my life. I love my job and the people I work with.</p>
