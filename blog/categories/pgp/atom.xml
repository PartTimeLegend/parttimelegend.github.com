    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So you've got your PGP Key and you want to get it signed? Excellent. That's how we build this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust">Web of Trust</a>.</p>

<h2>Why would I want my key signed?</h2>

<p>If you consider your PGP key as your digital identity then you must see the need to have this verified. The more signatures the more you are trusted.</p>

<h2>Will I sign your key?</h2>

<p>Sure will. All I need is for you to contact me to arrange a meeting. I would appreciate it if you also signed my key at the same time.</p>

<h2>What do I need to bring?</h2>

<p>I use a <a href="https://github.com/PartTimeLegend/web-of-trust-verification-forms">verification form</a> that I have released publically. You can either add your details and print it or hand write your details. I normally have a few spare when I meet people so you can always ask if you've not got one.</p>

<p>Just bring two forms of identification. I'll accept most things, but for reference:</p>

<ul>
<li>Passport</li>
<li>Driving Licence</li>
<li>Utility Bill</li>
<li>Bank Statement</li>
<li>Military Id Card</li>
<li>National Id Card</li>
<li>Student Id Card</li>
<li>Birth Certificate</li>
</ul>


<p>I will not accept:</p>

<ul>
<li>Self printed online banking statement</li>
<li>Letter from your grandmother</li>
</ul>


<h2>Do you charge for this service?</h2>

<p>This is a good question. The answer is a difficult one to answer.</p>

<p>I may ask for you to contribute towards travel costs either in full or part. This depends on your location and how I am feeling.</p>

<p>I may also as part of the verification process ask to take a £1 card payment from you. Once verified I will refund this amount to you as I only want to ensure you are able to authorise a payment. I will process this payment at location via mPOS.</p>

<h2>What information do you store?</h2>

<p>I store nothing. I only want to see your identification documents, I don't note any details and my memory isn't good enough to remember them anyway.</p>

<p>I will retain the paper document we complete with our details on. I store these until I get to a computer I can sign your key from. Once signed this document will be shredded, pulped, compressed and then burnt.</p>

<h2>I don't live in your city/country can will you still sign my key?</h2>

<p>I take these on a per request basis. Due to the nature of this, I will have to look carefully at your details and others who have signed your key. I reserve the right to charge for this service as it requires due dilligence on my part. This charge would not exceed £10 or the equivilent in your country and should be made via Bank Transfer to further confirm your identity. This will not result in a signature of absolute trust, you will receive a casual signature as I cannot absolutely gaurantee your identity.</p>

<h2>What keys have you signed and have signed you?</h2>

    <id>http://PartTimeLegend.github.com/blog/2013/04/16/i-built-a-pgp-key-server-on-my-raspberry-pi</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> which I like to toy with. I have another one that runs <a href="http://www.raspbmc.com/">Rasbmc</a>, but that's just for watching movies on.</p>

<p>Well I was updating my public key records for PGP/GPG and it occured to me that I should be able to run a small key server myself.</p>

<p>I have <a href="http://www.raspbian.org/">Raspbian</a> on my Pi which is a <a href="http://debian.org">Debian</a> based distro. Therefore it has the vast majority of the repositories that standard Debian has available to it.</p>

<p>First think I did was setup <a href="http://www.no-ip.org">no-ip</a> because my ISP doesn't provide static IPs to residential customers.</p>

<p>So from my laptop I start with these commands:</p>

<p><code>
ssh pi@x.x.x.x
</code></p>

<p>Replace <code>x.x.x.x</code> with your Pi's IP. Provide the password to login default is <code>raspberry</code>.</p>

<p>Now download and install No-IP.</p>

<p><code>
wget http://www.no-ip.com/client/linux/noip-duc-linux.tar.gz
tar xf noip-duc-linux.tar.gz
cd noip-2.1.9-1/
make install
</code></p>

<p>You will be prompted to put the login details for your account at No-IP. You will be asked how often to update, I sugest 360 which is 1 hour.</p>

<p>Now we need to set No-IP to run at boot.</p>

<p><code>
sudo nano /etc/rc.local
</code></p>

<p>Simply add the following line and close and save.</p>

<p><code>
/usr/local/bin/noip2
</code></p>

<p>Now we have a host we can use and we are ready for the main event.</p>

<p>As SKS is in your base repositories you can use.</p>

<p><code>
apt-get install sks
</code></p>

<p>Now build the database.</p>

<p><code>
sks build
</code></p>

<p>Now you need to get SKS to run at boot also.</p>

<p><code>
sudo nano /etc/default/sks
</code></p>

<p>Find the line.</p>

<p><code>
initstart=no
</code></p>

<p>Change it to.</p>

<p><code>
initstart=yes
</code></p>

<p>There you go. You have now got an SKS server running on your machine.</p>

<p>If you are looking for the web front end, then you can use the files from <a href="https://syslog.tv">syslog.tv</a>.</p>

<p>Create your directory.</p>

<p><code>
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/sks/www/
</code></p>

<p>Now copy the index file to it.</p>

<p><code>
wget http://syslog.tv/downloads/sks-index.html -O /var/lib/sks/www/index.html --no-check-certificate
</code></p>

<p>There you go. All setup and running.</p>

<p>You can sometimes access my key server <a href="http://antonybailey.no-ip.org:11371/">here</a>. Though I will probably give up and do something else in a week.</p>
